## 📊 Fuel Tracking Methodology

FuelTrackr uses the industry-standard **full-to-full method** for accurate mileage calculation:

1. **Full Fills Only** - Mileage calculated only between consecutive full tank fills
2. **Partial Fill Handling** - Partial fills contribute to totals but not per-fill mileage
3. **Distance Calculation** - Current odometer minus previous full fill odometer
4. **Fuel Consumption** - Sum of liters from previous full fill to current full fill

This ensures accurate km/L calculations that match real-world efficiency.
