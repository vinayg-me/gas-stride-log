# FuelTrackr Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for integrating FuelTrackr with Supabase backend, implementing authentication, offline capabilities, and comprehensive testing. The current application has a solid foundation with mock data and CRED-inspired UI components.

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ What's Already Implemented
- **UI Components**: Complete shadcn/ui component library with CRED-inspired styling
- **Storybook**: Comprehensive component documentation and stories
- **Mock Data**: Sample cars, fuel logs, and statistics for development
- **State Management**: Zustand store with app state structure
- **Routing**: React Router setup with basic page structure
- **Design System**: Dark theme, glassmorphism effects, animations with Framer Motion
- **PWA Foundation**: Basic manifest and service worker setup
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with domain models defined

### ❌ What's Missing
- **Database Schema**: Supabase tables and RLS policies
- **Authentication**: User login/signup and protected routes
- **Real Data Integration**: API calls and data fetching with TanStack Query
- **Offline Capabilities**: IndexedDB with Dexie and background sync
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form integration with validation
- **File Upload**: Receipt image handling with Supabase Storage
- **Analytics**: Real chart data and calculations
- **Export/Import**: CSV/XLSX functionality

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will be done in **feature-driven phases**, with each phase including:
1. **Backend Setup** (Database schema, API endpoints)
2. **Frontend Implementation** (Components, forms, logic)
3. **Testing** (Unit tests, integration tests with MSW, E2E with Playwright)
4. **Storybook Updates** (New stories for implemented features)

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Feature | Duration | Priority |
|-------|---------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Database & Authentication | 3-4 days | Critical |
| 2 | Car Management | 2-3 days | High |
| 3 | Fuel Log Management | 3-4 days | High |
| 4 | Analytics & Charts | 2-3 days | High |
| 5 | Offline Capabilities | 3-4 days | Medium |
| 6 | Advanced Features | 2-3 days | Low |
| 7 | Testing & Polish | 2-3 days | High |

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Vitest + React Testing Library)
- Component logic and rendering
- Utility functions (mileage calculations, data transformations)
- Store actions and state updates
- Form validation and submission

### Integration Tests (Mock Service Worker)
- API integration with mocked Supabase responses
- Data flow between components and store
- Form submission and error handling
- Authentication flows

### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)
- Complete user journeys (signup → add car → add fuel log → view analytics)
- Offline functionality testing
- PWA installation and features
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript First**: All new code must be fully typed
- **Testing Required**: Every feature must have unit and integration tests
- **Storybook Stories**: All new components need Storybook documentation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance**: Lighthouse score >90 for all metrics

### Development Workflow
1. **Create Feature Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/phase-X-feature-name`
2. **Implement Backend**: Database schema, RLS policies, API endpoints
3. **Implement Frontend**: Components, forms, state management
4. **Write Tests**: Unit → Integration → E2E
5. **Update Storybook**: Add/update component stories
6. **Code Review**: Self-review checklist before PR
7. **Testing**: Run full test suite and manual testing
8. **Documentation**: Update README and implementation docs

### Git Commit Convention
```
feat: add user authentication with Supabase Auth
fix: resolve mileage calculation for partial fills
test: add integration tests for fuel log creation
docs: update API documentation for car endpoints
refactor: optimize car statistics calculation
style: improve responsive design for mobile devices
```

## Next Steps

1. **Review this plan** with the team and adjust priorities if needed
2. **Set up development environment** with testing dependencies
3. **Start with Phase 1**: Database schema and authentication
4. **Follow the feature-driven approach** with testing at each step
5. **Regular progress reviews** after each phase completion

## Notes

- **Mock Data Preservation**: Keep existing mock data for Storybook and development
- **Incremental Migration**: Gradually replace mock data with real API calls
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing components continue to work during migration
- **Error Boundaries**: Implement proper error handling for production readiness
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track bundle size and runtime performance throughout development
